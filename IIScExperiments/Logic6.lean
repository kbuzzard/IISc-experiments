# Logic in Lean, example sheet 6 : "or" (∨`)

We learn about how to manipulate `P ∨ Q` in Lean.

## Tactics

You'll need to know about the tactics from the previous sheets,
and also the following tactics

* `left` and `right`
* `cases'` (new functionality)

-- Throughout this sheet, `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S` will denote propositions.

variable (P Q R S : Prop)

example : P → P ∨ Q := by
  sorry

example : Q → P ∨ Q := by
  sorry

example : P ∨ Q → (P → R) → (Q → R) → R := by
  sorry

-- symmetry of `or`
example : P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P := by
  sorry

-- associativity of `or`
example : (P ∨ Q) ∨ R ↔ P ∨ (Q ∨ R) := by
  sorry

example : (P → R) → (Q → S) → P ∨ Q → R ∨ S := by
  sorry

example : (P → Q) → P ∨ R → Q ∨ R := by
  sorry

example : (P ↔ R) → (Q ↔ S) → (P ∨ Q ↔ R ∨ S) := by
  sorry

-- de Morgan's laws
example : ¬ (P ∨ Q) ↔ ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q := by
  sorry

example : ¬ (P ∧ Q) ↔ ¬ P ∨ ¬ Q := by
