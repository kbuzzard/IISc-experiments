# Learning resources

Learning resources for mathematicians.

Right now the community is in a transitional period. We are switching
from Lean 3 to Lean 4. Under the hood, Lean 4 is a far more sophisticated
and powerful system, but as a mathematician end user the systems are
pretty much the same. Currently we are exactly half way through translating our mathematics library from Lean 3 to Lean 4. I'm writing this in April 2023. Within six months Lean 3 will be retired and we'll all be using Lean 4. Right now Lean 4 only has half a mathematics library (so you can do commutative algebra but you can't do manifolds)

## Lean 3 learning resources

Right now, the [community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io) has instructions on how to install Lean 3 for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Once you have it installed, there is a community [tutorial](https://github.com/leanprover-community/tutorials) which you can install with `leanproject get tutorials` and then you can open the resulting directory with VS Code.

Other Lean 3 learning resources: My undergraduate course has a repository full of code [here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2023) and accompanying course notes [here](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2023/)

Jeremy Avigad and others are writing a book called "Mathematics in Lean". The book is [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)

If you have questions about anything, you can ask on the Lean Zulip [here](leanprover.zulipchat.com).

## Lean 4 learning resources

This repository is probably the most relevant for mathematicians. For
basic stuff you can also read [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/).
